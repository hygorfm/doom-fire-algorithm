# doom-fire-algorithm
this simple project shows a fire animation inspired by the game called "DOOM"


How to get started with the application:

--> The quickest way: just run 'npx serve' command in your project's directory.

Or, if you prefer, you can also install the package globally using Yarn (you'll need at least Node.js LTS), 
then run the following command at the terminal/cmd:

      yarn global add serve
  
Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory:

      serve
      
Then open the localhost server in your web browser.
